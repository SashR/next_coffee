********************            6: Section Overview                 ************************
-- Next.js can be a full stack solution
-- It has both pros and cons over pure React
-- You will learn what it is, why is it popular and when to use it


********************            7: What is next.js                 ************************
-- It is a framework built on top of React that gives you the flexibility of building scalable apps by allowing you to 
    render content on the server.
-- You will also be building backend via a node server that provided out of the box.
-- Very flexible, can choose when to use SSR, CSR or a mixture.




********************            8:  Learn react fundamentals                 ************************
********************            9: Benefits of Next.js and different rendering techniques                 ************************
-- Different rendering techniques:
        - Static Site generations (SSG) (Products; blog stores; coffee site example; general marketting content)  -- BUILD TIME generations
            -- All content prebuilt on server; server passes content to client and is cached. Client fetches cached content over and over;
                very high performance
        - Server Side rendering (SSR) E.g. Dynamic news feed, Netflix           -- GENERATE PAGE ON THE Server
            -- Content render on server each tine on refresh; dynamic content
        - Incremental Side Regeneration (ISR) -- Static plus server, infinite scrolling features            -- GENERATE PAGE
            ON BUILD IN ADVANCE + SERVER AFTER

        Client (Browser)    -- Server (Node.js)


********************            10: Performance with Next.js                  ************************
-- Building Performant apps are hard; next extrapolates alot of this
-- Code splitting is when you divide you web app in to small chunks so you can only load the chunk that is used by the current PAGE
-- React needs additional packages and extra knowledge; while this is down by next out of the box
-- next build creates an optimized build of your app for you to deploy
-- Next also minifies code; removing special chars and whitespace; shrinking the file size further hence app is more Performant
-- React needs webpack to handle this; which can be completed. Still need some of this domain knowledge

-- Next provides an Image component; which automatically optimizes images. This again boosts performance.
-- Next serves the image size based on the browser size; automatic resizing. Also other cool features are available
-- Pre-fetching assets -- next will fetch assets as you scroll


********************            11: Image component with Next.js                 ************************
-- Using chrome devtools we can see the sizes of next js images changing as you change the window size and refresh.
-- Lower file sizes for mobile users makes sites more performant and less costly for the users
-- we can also see images being download on scroll, just before the image comes into the viewport


********************            12: File based routing and seo                 ************************
-- Allows for easy routing based on file locations
-- Files inside pages directory are treated as routes
-- /pages/catalog/product.tsx is treated as a route, which can be passed to a link component. Dynamic routes are also available.
    The next routing system, also applies code splitting to the routes; boosting performance
-- React requires react router library to provide similar but inferior functionality

-- The api folder under pages will hold all backend logic; any route there is a server side route

-- Search Engine Optimization -- a language for web crawlers.
-- Good titles, metadata; good semantic HTML;  improves SEO ranking (allows bots to understand it better)
-- a higher rank allows the site to be more discoverable on google

-- Next provides a head component allowing easily update the title for each page

********************            14: Severless functions in Next                 ************************
-- Found inside API folder.
-- Allow for backend logic to be handled by next, making it fullstack
-- Only runs when needed
-- Can talk to databases


********************            15: next.js vs create-react-app                ************************
-- Provides alot of functionality out of box that needs to be configured, installed, setup via create-react-app
-- Webpack is also needed knowledge, but not for next.js
-- Knowledge of these concepts are still needed (domain knowledge) 
-- Complex of choice gets avoided
-- Rendering techniques are easily setup and switchable in next.js
-- cra is still usable for small apps
